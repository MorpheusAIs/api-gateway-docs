<Note>
Welcome to the Morpheus Inference API. We appreciate you spending the time to help us test prior to our billing implementation, and hope that you are as excited as we are for this new addition to the Morpheus Ecosystem.
</Note>

## What is the Morpheus Inference Marketplace?

The Morpheus Inference Marketplace is a decentralized network where **providers** host AI models and **consumers** access inference. The Morpheus Inference API abstracts all of this complexity—you just need an API key to get started.

**Key benefits:**
- **Free inference** during Open Beta (until 1/31/26)
- **OpenAI-compatible** — works with any tool that supports OpenAI's API
- **Decentralized** — no single point of failure, protects your data
- **No wallet required** — just create an account and start building

<Warning>
**The Morpheus Inference API is FREE during the Open Beta.** Login, grab an API key, and you're ready to go.

Billing infrastructure will be implemented soon. Free inference will be available natively, or via credit allocation until 1/31/26.
</Warning>
