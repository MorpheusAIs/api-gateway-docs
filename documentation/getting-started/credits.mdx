# Credits & Billing

To use the Morpheus Inference API, you need credits. All credits and billing are denominated in **USD amounts**. This page explains how to obtain credits, how they are consumed, and how your daily credit allowance is calculated.

---

## Accessing Billing

To manage your credits, go to [app.mor.org](https://app.mor.org) and click the **Billing** tab in the left sidebar.

/>

The Billing page shows your **Available Credit** (pre-paid balance) and **Daily API credit remaining** (staking allowance), along with options for adding funds and managing your staking connection.

## How to Obtain Credits

There are two ways to acquire credits:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Purchase Credits" icon="credit-card">
  Buy credits directly with a credit card or cryptocurrency. Credits are added to your **Available Credit** balance immediately.
</Card>

<Card title="Stake MOR Tokens" icon="coins">
  Stake MOR tokens to earn a **Daily Credit Allowance** that refreshes every day at midnight UTC.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Option A: Purchasing Credits

You can purchase credits directly from the **Add Funds** section on the Billing page. Two payment methods are available:

- **Credit Card** — Powered by Stripe
- **Pay with Crypto** — Powered by Coinbase Commerce

/>

Purchased credits are added to your **Available Credit** balance and do not expire.

---

## Option B: Staking MOR for Daily Credits

You can earn a daily credit allowance by staking MOR tokens into the **Morpheus Marketplace API** builder subnet. This gives you a recurring daily credit allocation without purchasing credits directly.

### Step 1: Stake MOR Tokens

Go to the [Morpheus Marketplace API builder subnet on the Morpheus Dashboard](https://dashboard.mor.org/builders/morpheus-marketplace-api?subnet_id=0x415471125cc4d03b89818acb8426981fa28a3eee03a9097176297a9a6ae87c8d&network=Base) and stake your MOR tokens.

/>

### Step 2: Connect Your Wallet

Once you have staked in the subnet, return to the Billing page on [app.mor.org](https://app.mor.org). In the **Staking Status** section, connect the same wallet you used to stake and assign it to your Morpheus account.

  alt="Staking Status section with Connect Wallet button"
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem', border: '2px solid rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.3)' }}
/>

After connecting, your daily credit allowance will appear under **Daily API credit remaining** on the Billing page.

---

## Credit Usage Order

<Note>
By default, the API will **first consume your Daily Credit Allowance** from staking. Once your daily allowance is fully exhausted, pre-paid credits from your **Available Credit** balance will begin being used — but only if you have enabled the **Allow Overages** toggle.
</Note>

<img
  src="/images/billing/allow-overages.png"
  alt="Allow Overages toggle — use credit balance when daily allowance runs out"
  style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem', border: '2px solid rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.3)' }}
/>

| Priority | Credit Source | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1st | Daily Credit Allowance | Free daily credits earned from staking MOR |
| 2nd | Available Credit | Pre-paid credits (used only when daily allowance is exhausted and overages are enabled) |

<Warning>
If **Allow Overages** is disabled (the default), only your Daily Staking Allowance will be used. Once it runs out, API requests will stop working until the next daily refresh. Enable **Allow Overages** if you want pre-paid credits to kick in automatically.
</Warning>

---

## How Daily Credit Allowance is Calculated

Your daily credit allowance from staking is derived by three factors:

1. **Your stake** — The amount of MOR you have staked in the Morpheus Marketplace API builder subnet.
2. **Total stake** — The total amount of MOR staked by all users in all builder subnets.
3. **MOR token price** — The current market price of the MOR token in USD.

### The Calculation

Your daily credit allowance is proportional to your **share** of the total stake in the builder protocol, adjusted with the current MOR token price:

```
Daily Credit Allowance (USD) = (Your MOR Staked / Total MOR Staked) × Daily Credit Pool
```

The **Daily Credit Pool** is derived from the builder subnet's rewards, priced in USD using the current MOR token market price.

### Refresh Schedule

<Info>
Credits are **calculated and refreshed daily at midnight UTC**. Your allowance will be **recalculated at the next refresh period** (midnight UTC) according to your stake, the total staked amount and changes to the price of MOR.
</Info>

**Key points:**
- Staking more MOR increases your share and therefore your daily allowance.
- If other users stake or unstake, your proportional share (and allowance) will change at the next refresh.
- MOR token price fluctuations affect the USD value of your daily allowance.
- Changes to your stake are **not reflected immediately** — they take effect at the next midnight UTC refresh.
