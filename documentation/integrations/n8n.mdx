# How To Integrate with n8n

### What is n8n?

n8n is a powerful workflow automation platform that allows you to connect various services and automate tasks. With its OpenAI-compatible node, you can easily integrate the Morpheus Inference API into your automation workflows.

<Note>
The n8n integration guide is currently under development. Check back soon for detailed instructions on how to integrate n8n with Morpheus.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- Morpheus API Key from [app.mor.org](https://app.mor.org)
- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- Basic familiarity with n8n workflows

## Quick Setup

Since the Morpheus Inference API is **fully OpenAI-compatible**, you can use n8n's OpenAI node with custom credentials.

### Step 1: Create Custom Credentials

In n8n, create new OpenAI credentials with:

- **API Key:** Your Morpheus API key
- **Base URL:** `https://api.mor.org/api/v1`

### Step 2: Configure the OpenAI Node

Add an OpenAI node to your workflow and select your Morpheus credentials.

### Step 3: Set the Model

Use any available Morpheus model such as:
- `llama-3.3-70b`
- `qwen3-235b`
- `mistral-31-24b`

## Coming Soon

This integration guide will include:

- Step-by-step credential configuration with screenshots
- Example workflows for common use cases
- Chat completion node configuration
- Embedding generation for RAG workflows
- Error handling and retry strategies
- Best practices for production workflows

Stay tuned for updates!
