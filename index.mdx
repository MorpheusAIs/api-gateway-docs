# Morpheus Inference API

The Morpheus Inference API is a simple, easy-to-use, OpenAI API Compatible gateway providing users access to the Morpheus Inference Marketplace. Use the Morpheus Base URL and plug in the Inference API anywhere to begin your journey with Morpheus.

## What is the Morpheus Inference Marketplace?

The Morpheus Inference Marketplace allows for both "consumers" and "providers" to host nodes to participate within the marketplace. Providers "host" hardware and offer access to inference within the marketplace, becoming accessible to various consumers like the Inference API. The Morpheus Inference API abstracts these efforts to provide a simple, seamless experience, without the need to host a node. 

<Warning>
**The Morpheus Inference API is a way for users to access AI inference for FREE. There is no cost. Login, grab an API key, and you are ready to go.**

**We will be implementing a billing infrastructure soon. Free inference will be available natively, or via credit allocation until 1/31/26.**
</Warning>
