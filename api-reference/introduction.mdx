## Welcome to Morpheus API Gateway

The Morpheus API Gateway connects Web2 clients to the Morpheus-Lumerin AI Marketplace. This gateway provides OpenAI-compatible endpoints for seamless integration with existing AI applications.

## Base URL

```
https://api.mor.org/api/v1
```

All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`. For example:
- Models: `https://api.mor.org/api/v1/models`
- Chat: `https://api.mor.org/api/v1/chat/completions`
- Embeddings: `https://api.mor.org/api/v1/embeddings`


## Authentication

The API uses two authentication methods:

### Bearer Token (JWT)
Used for user-level endpoints like account management, API key generation, and settings. This is handled on the back-end within the [Open Beta portal](https://app.mor.org)

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

### API Key
Used for AI inference endpoints like chat completions and model listings.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## API Categories

- **Models**: List and query available AI models and bids
- **Chat**: OpenAI-compatible chat completion endpoints
- **Embeddings**: Embeddings endpoint to support vector storage (RAG)
- ** Utility**: Health Checks

## Rate Limits

Rate limits are applied per API key and vary based on your account tier. Contact support for enterprise rate limits. These have yet to be implemented.

## Error Handling

- `400` - Bad Request
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `403` - Forbidden
- `404` - Not Found
- `422` - Validation Error

  "detail": [
    {
      "loc": ["body", "field_name"],
      "msg": "Field required",
      "type": "missing"

}
```
