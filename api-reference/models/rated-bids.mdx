<Info>
  **Understanding Ratings**: Provider ratings are calculated based on session success rate, response time, and user feedback. Higher-rated providers typically offer more reliable service.
</Info>

<Tip>
  **Cost Calculation**: To calculate the total session cost, multiply `price_per_second` by your desired session duration. For example, a 1-hour session (3600 seconds) at 0.000014 MOR/second would cost 0.0504 MOR.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Use the `bid_id` from this response when creating a session with `/api/v1/session/bidsession` to select a specific provider.
