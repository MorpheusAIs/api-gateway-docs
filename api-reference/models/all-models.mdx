<Info>
  **All Models vs Active Models**: 
  - `/api/v1/models` - Returns only active models with available providers (recommended for most use cases)
  - `/api/v1/models/allmodels` - Returns all non-deleted models regardless of status
</Info>

<Tip>
  Use this endpoint to discover all models in the marketplace, including those that may be temporarily unavailable or in testing.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Models marked as deleted are excluded from the response. Only models that exist on the blockchain and haven't been soft-deleted are returned.
