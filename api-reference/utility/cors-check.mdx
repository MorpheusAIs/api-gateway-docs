CORS configuration test endpoint for ALB lb_cookie stickiness verification.

This endpoint helps verify that CORS is properly configured for cross-origin requests with credentials, which is required for AWS ALB sticky sessions. Returns CORS configuration details and request information for debugging.

<Info>
  **ALB Sticky Sessions**: This endpoint is specifically designed to help debug CORS configuration issues that can affect AWS Application Load Balancer sticky sessions. Sticky sessions require `credentials: 'include'` in fetch requests, which in turn requires proper CORS configuration.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Cross-Origin Requests**: For the API to work from a web browser with a different origin (domain), your origin must be in the `allowed_origins` list. Contact support if you need to add an origin.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Debugging CORS Issues**:
  1. Check that `cors_enabled` is `true`
  2. Verify your origin is in `allowed_origins`
  3. Ensure `credentials_allowed` is `true` if you're using cookies or auth tokens
  4. Confirm the `Access-Control-Allow-*` response headers match your request
</Tip>

<Note>
  **Browser DevTools**: Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to inspect CORS-related response headers. Look for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`, etc.
</Note>

<Info>
  **Preflight Requests**: For methods other than GET/POST or when using custom headers, browsers send an OPTIONS preflight request first. The CORS configuration must allow both the preflight and the actual request.
