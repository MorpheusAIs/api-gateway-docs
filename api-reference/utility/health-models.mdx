<Info>
  **Operational Monitoring**: This endpoint provides detailed insights into the model service's operational status, making it invaluable for debugging and monitoring the health of the model marketplace integration.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Authentication Required**: Unlike the general health endpoint, this requires API key authentication as it exposes detailed operational information.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Troubleshooting**: If you're experiencing issues with model availability:
  1. Check this endpoint to see if the blockchain connection is healthy
  2. Verify the cache is updating regularly
  3. Check if active models are available
  4. Contact support with the timestamp and model statistics if issues persist
</Tip>

<Note>
  The cache refresh interval is typically 5-10 minutes. If the `last_updated` timestamp is significantly older, there may be an issue with the model fetching service.
</Note>
