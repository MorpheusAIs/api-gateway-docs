<Info>
  **Monitoring**: This endpoint is designed for load balancers, monitoring systems, and health check tools. It provides essential diagnostic information without exposing sensitive data.
</Info>

<Tip>
  **Container ID**: The `container_id` field is useful for correlating health check results with specific container instances in multi-instance deployments. Include this in support requests for faster issue resolution.
</Tip>

<Note>
  This endpoint does not require authentication and should be used by monitoring systems to check API availability. A 200 status code with `"status": "healthy"` indicates the system is operational.
