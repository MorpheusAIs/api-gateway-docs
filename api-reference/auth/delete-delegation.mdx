  Bearer token (JWT) from OAuth2 login
</ParamField>

### Path Parameters

<ParamField path="delegation_id" type="integer" required>
  The ID of the delegation to delete
</ParamField>

### Response

Returns `204 No Content` on successful deletion.

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl --request DELETE \
  --url https://api.mor.org/api/v1/auth/delegation/1 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.mor.org/api/v1/auth/delegation/1',
  {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN'
    }
  }
);

// Response will be empty on success (204)
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.delete(
    'https://api.mor.org/api/v1/auth/delegation/1',
    headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN'}
)

# Response status code will be 204 on success
```
</RequestExample>

}
```

  "detail": [
    {
      "loc": ["path", "delegation_id"],
      "msg": "Input should be a valid integer",
      "type": "int_parsing"
    }
  ]
}

</ResponseExample>

<Warning>
  **Immediate Effect**: Deleting a delegation takes effect immediately. The delegated address will lose access to perform actions on your behalf as soon as the deletion is processed.
</Warning>

<Info>
  You can only delete delegations that belong to your account. Attempting to delete another user's delegation will result in a 404 error.
</Info>

<Note>
  If you want to temporarily disable a delegation without deleting it, consider updating it with `is_active: false` instead (requires a PUT endpoint implementation).
</Note>
