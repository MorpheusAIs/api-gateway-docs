description: "Delete a specific delegation for the user"

Deletes a specific delegation for the user.

This removes the delegation from the system. The delegated address will no longer have authority to perform actions on your behalf.

### Headers

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required>
  Bearer token (JWT) from OAuth2 login
</ParamField>

### Path Parameters

<ParamField path="delegation_id" type="integer" required>
  The ID of the delegation to delete
</ParamField>

### Response

Returns `204 No Content` on successful deletion.

<Warning>
  **Immediate Effect**: Deleting a delegation takes effect immediately. The delegated address will lose access to perform actions on your behalf as soon as the deletion is processed.
</Warning>

<Info>
  You can only delete delegations that belong to your account. Attempting to delete another user's delegation will result in a 404 error.
</Info>

<Note>
  If you want to temporarily disable a delegation without deleting it, consider updating it with `is_active: false` instead (requires a PUT endpoint implementation).
</Note>
