<Warning>
  **Security Best Practices**:
  - Never share your private key with anyone
  - Never commit private keys to version control
  - Consider using environment variables or secure vaults to manage private keys
  - The gateway encrypts the key before storage using your Cognito identity
</Warning>

<Info>
  **Key Encryption**: Your private key is encrypted using your Cognito user identity before being stored. This means only you can use it for blockchain operations through the gateway.
</Info>

<Note>
  If you already have a private key stored, calling this endpoint will replace it with the new key.
