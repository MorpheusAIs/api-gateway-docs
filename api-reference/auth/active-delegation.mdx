<Info>
  **Single Active Delegation**: The system enforces that only one delegation can be active at a time. Creating a new active delegation will automatically deactivate any existing active delegation.
</Info>

<Note>
  Check if the response is `null` to determine whether the user has an active delegation before attempting to use delegated authority.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Use this endpoint to quickly check delegation status before performing operations that require delegated authority.
