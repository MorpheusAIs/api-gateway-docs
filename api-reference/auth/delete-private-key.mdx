title: "Delete Private Key"
api: "DELETE /api/v1/auth/private-key"
description: "Delete a user's private key"
---

Delete a user's private key from the gateway.

This action is irreversible and will prevent you from performing blockchain operations that require the private key, such as approving token spending or creating new sessions.

### Headers

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required>
  Bearer token (JWT) from OAuth2 login
</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  Success message confirming the key was deleted
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="deleted_at" type="string">
  ISO 8601 timestamp when the key was deleted
</ResponseField>

<Warning>
  **Irreversible Action**: After deleting your private key, you will need to store it again to perform blockchain operations. Make sure you have your private key saved elsewhere before deleting it from the gateway.
</Warning>

<Note>
  After deleting your private key, you can still use the gateway for AI inference operations, but blockchain operations like session creation and token approvals will not be available until you store a new key.
</Note>
