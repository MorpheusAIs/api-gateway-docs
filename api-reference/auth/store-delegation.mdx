  **Gator SDK**: Use the [Gator SDK](https://github.com/morpheusais/gator) to properly construct and sign delegation data before submitting it to this endpoint.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Delegation Security**: Delegating authority to another address allows that address to perform actions on your behalf. Only delegate to addresses you trust completely.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Set an expiry date for delegations to automatically revoke them after a certain time period for additional security.
