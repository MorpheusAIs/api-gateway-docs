<Info>
  **Automatic Selection**: This endpoint is designed for automatic API key selection when users log in. It returns the oldest key, which is typically the user's primary or first-created key.
</Info>

<Note>
  Only active API keys are considered. If you have inactive keys, they will not be returned by this endpoint.
</Note>

<Tip>
  If you want to get the user's preferred API key instead of just the oldest one, use the `/api/v1/auth/keys/default` endpoint which respects user preferences.
